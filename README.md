# credits_public
- Forked version of Frums - Credits animation repository.
- Trimmed all `just-playback` related function. **Require manual song syncing. You should only use this if you can't install `just-playback`.**
- Totally multiplatform.
- Tested on clean Python 3.10 (macOS) with minimal modules installed.
